## **Question 1:** How does the quantitative genetic architecture of woody biomass shift alongside a variable environment? 

**Hypothesis:** Local adaptation has produced constraints on certain genotypes to persist outside of their optimal operating environmental envelopes.

**Approach:** Leverage the ability to clone genotypes and rear 30-50 clones across a gradient of 9-12 common gardens to capture the ability for genotypes to operate under varying climates (growing degree day?).   

**Part 1. Next, we will assess growth performance (function-valued trait) across these common gardens and identify constraints within a quantitative genetic framework.**  

We will do this by estimating the broad-sense variance-covariance G-matrix and identify trade-offs by decomposing **G** with a PCA to quantify the correlational structure. Plot PCA loadings as a function of environment. 

Predictions: 

[Kingsolver et al. 2015](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/681083)

1. If we see A and B, no constraints among genotypes    
2. If we see C-D, constraints between low-high environmental axis   
3. If we see E-F, generalist-specialist axis of variation    

The cool thing here is that any of these possibilities can be captured by PC1, which explains the most variation. 

A different approach: [Template mode variation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16032579)

**Part 2. Correlate responses of genotypes to where they were found (source population)**    

We could fit functions to growth curves and then extract parameters. Plot parameters against source climate. This will get at the local adaptation part. 

Notes:        

1. **We can also couple a viability experiment in this project**     
2. Genomics part to develop: **Function valued traits are dynamic, are the same loci always involved?**, do QTL?        
3. I do want to add an additional 3 levels of moisture(or other important environmental parameter), but just kept the 9-12 common gardens for now. I do have ideas and resources for how to analyze the added factors [here](https://github.com/adnguyen/Dissertation_temperature_adaptation_ants/blob/master/General_Notebook.md#page-2-2016-05-13-comparing-g-matrices-of-different-populations).

## **Question 2:** Are there novel shifts in episodic selection regimes in poplar?     

**Hypothesis:** Human-induced climate change is altering selective regimes in natural populations. And can we predict future responses to climate change to determine genotypes that are resilient or susceptible? 


**Approach:** Overlay and compare historical and contemporary selection regimes. Phenotype and collect samples out in the field and compare with common garden. When in the field, estimate historical selection.

# Broader Impacts    

```How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society?```

**Strategies:**     
1. Develop my own skills as a scientist by honing my skills in genomics     
2. As an under represented group, I will be able to attract other ethnicities to engage in research. I will mentor undergraduate researchers.

# Intellectual Merit  

```How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?```  

**Strategies:**    
1. I will utilize evolutionary theory to understand basic principles about what limits organisms to persist; these findings will extend to large-scale production of woody biomass    
2. This work will help us understand the determinants of resiliency or susceptibility to human-induced environmental change.

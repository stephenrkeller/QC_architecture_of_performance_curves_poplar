# Andrew Mentoring plan notes:
### 2016-08-30 

### Knowledge base
1. weak on popgen theory and application --> provide mentoring to boost skills in these areas    
2. bioinformatics:     
	* have done: written some python scripts (a bit ago); lots of R (physiology, traits, GIS, phylogenetics, mixed models), some UNIX, some VIM, grep    
	* would like: more genomic sequences (fastq, developing pipelines, mapping and variant calling, annotation and enrichment analyses)    
	* grow more in genomic stats (tests for selection, genomic prediction)     


### Different plans of mentoring	 

* provide 1-on-1 training in bioinformatics as above   
* develop shared collaborative analyses with members of labgroup (hackathons on bioinf problems)   
* Integrate a teaching element into PBIO381 (Ecological Genomics) and have Andrew develop a short course module on genomic analyses applied to a pop/eco problem, maybe gene-env selection scans    
* Working together on project management (budgets, data storage, working with collaborators)    
* Communicating science: (PAG, SSE)   
* Evaluating broader impacts (evals from HS teachers on the lesson plant)   
* Building collab network among plant biologists (host invited speakers, organize workshop or public lecture, host guest lecture in PBIO381...)   
* We write an RCN  proposal together on poplar common garden QG and GWAS data    
* Organize a regional conference and host @ UVM, or organize a symposium at one of the society conferences (ASN, SSE, etc)

        <p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>
         
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) awards Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology to recent recipients of the doctoral degree for research and training in <em>selected </em>areas supported by BIO and with special goals for human resource development in biology.  The fellowships encourage independence at an early stage of the research career to permit Fellows to pursue their research and training goals in the most appropriate research locations regardless of the availability of funding for the Fellows at that site.  For FY 2015 and beyond, these BIO programs are<em><strong> (1) Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology, (2) Research Using Biological Collections, and  (3) National Plant Genome Initiative (NPGI) Postdoctoral Research Fellowships.</strong></em>  These areas change periodically as new scientific and infrastructure opportunities present themselves. For this reason, this solicitation will be changed as necessary to reflect the areas being funded.</p>
            <p>The fellowships are also designed to provide active mentoring of the Fellows by the sponsoring scientists who will benefit from having these talented young scientists in their research groups. The research and training plan of each fellowship must address important scientific questions within the scope of the BIO Directorate and the specific guidelines in this fellowship program solicitation.  Because the fellowships are offered to postdoctoral scientists only early in their careers, NSF encourages doctoral advisors to discuss the availability of these postdoctoral fellowships in biology with their graduate students early in their doctoral programs to ensure potential applicants may take advantage of this funding opportunity. Fellowships are awards to individuals, not institutions, and are administered by the Fellows. </p>

          <p>BIO offers Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology to provide opportunities for scientists early in their careers who are ready to assume independence in their research efforts and to obtain training beyond their graduate education in preparation for scientific careers, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons. Fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts beyond traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including international locations. Fellows must affiliate with appropriate research institutions and are expected to devote themselves full time to the fellowship activities for the duration of the fellowship.  The fellowships have both research and training goals.</p>
          <p>Currently BIO offers Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology in the following three areas:</p>
          <p>Competitive Area 1.  Postdoctoral Fellowships for Broadening Participation in Biology.</p>
          <p>These fellowships have been offered since FY 1990 as the NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowships to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in biology.  The program supports a wide range of biological research and training across the full range of BIO's research programs.</p>
          <p>Competitive Area 2.  Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Using Biological Collections.</p>
          <p>Biological research collections represent the documented scientific history of life on Earth, and the U.S. museum community alone curates over a billion specimens ranging from bacteria to plants, insects and vertebrates, as well as fossils. Across the globe, collections represent critical infrastructure and support essential research activities in biology and its related fields. Scientists, government agencies, industry and citizens utilize collections to document and understand evolution and biodiversity, study global change, formulate advice on conservation planning, educate the general public, improve interactions between sciences, and devise new practical applications from science to everyday life. New technologies supported by NSF in digitization, such as the Advancing Digitization of Biodiversity Collections (ADBC) program, are making collections and their associated data, whether they are physical specimens, text, images, sounds, or data tables, searchable in online databases. Despite this clear progress in improving access to physical specimens and their associated metadata, collections remain under-utilized for answering contemporary questions about fundamental aspects of biological processes.  Thus, collections are poised to become a critical resource for developing transformative approaches to address key questions in biology and potentially develop applications that extend biology to physical, mathematical, engineering and social sciences. This postdoctoral track seeks transformative approaches that use biological collections in highly innovative ways to address grand challenges in biology.  Priority may be given to applicants who integrate biological collections and associated resources with other types of data in an effort to forge new insight into areas traditionally funded by BIO.  Examples of key questions in biology of interest include, but are not limited to, links between genotype and phenotype, evolutionary developmental biology, comparative approaches in functional and developmental neurobiology, and the biophysics of nanostructures.  Using collections as a resource for grand challenge questions in biology is expected to present new opportunities to advance understanding of biological processes and systems, inspiring new discoveries in areas with relevance to other disciplines with overlapping interests in biological systems.  Applicants must document access to the selected collection(s) in the research and training plan.  </p>
          <p> Competitive Area 3. National Plant Genome Initiative (NPGI) Postdoctoral Research Fellowships</p>
          <p>The NPGI fellowships will be co-sponsored by NSF, US Department of Energy (DOE), and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) - Agricultural Research Service (ARS) to allow the recipients to focus their studies in plant genomics with an emphasis on quantitative genetics, modern breeding approaches, and bioinformatics. These fellowships are designed to provide active mentoring of the Fellows by the sponsoring scientists who will benefit from having these talented young scientists in their research groups. The research and training plan of each fellowship must address important scientific questions within the scope of the goals of the NPGI and the specific guidelines in this Solicitation. Opportunities to participate in research in USDA-ARS laboratories and the DOE's Joint Genome Institute will be possible as part of the training activities for the postdoctoral fellows.  International training may be included in the research plan provided that it is relevant to the goals of the NPGI and within the scope of this Program.</p>

          II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
        </h3>
         
          <p><strong>Fellowship Competitive Area 1: Broadening Participation in Biology</strong></p>
          <p>Through this program, BIO seeks to increase the diversity of scientists at the postdoctoral level in biology, and thereby contribute to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific enterprise.  Groups that are significantly underrepresented in biology in the U.S. include Native Americans, including Alaskan Natives and Native Pacific Islanders, African Americans, and Hispanics.  Individuals with disabilities are also under represented.  The goal of the program is to prepare minority biologists and others who share NSF's diversity goals for positions of scientific leadership in academia, industry, and government.  The research and training plan in these applications must fall within the purview of BIO and explain how the fellowship award will broaden or effectively encourage broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities in biology supported by BIO. </p>
          <p><strong>Fellowship Competitive Area 2: Interdisciplinary Research Using Biological Collections. </strong></p>
          <p>Biological research collections represent the documented scientific history of life on Earth and the U.S. museum community alone curates over a billion specimens ranging from bacteria to plants, insects and vertebrates, as well as fossils. Across the globe, collections represent a critical infrastructure and support essential research activities in biology and other fields.  Scientists, government agencies, industry and citizens utilize collections to document and understand evolution and biodiversity, study global change, formulate advice on conservation planning, educate the general public, improve interactions between sciences, and devise new practical applications from science to everyday life.  </p>
          <p>New technologies, including NSF-led programs in digitization, are reinvigorating collections-based research in the U.S.  Collections data are becoming searchable whether they are physical specimens, text, images, sounds, or data tables in easily accessible online integrated databases. Despite clear progress in improving access, a considerable amount of  information on physical specimens remains unexplored, awaiting new analysis, instrumentation, and methods to study their structure and composition and their use in answering contemporary questions about basic biology. Thus, collections also are a critical resource for potentially transformative approaches to addressing questions and developing applications that extend biology to physical, mathematical, engineering and social sciences.  Using collections as the source for interdisciplinary bio-inspired approaches and designs has multilateral benefits: 1) it benefits biology by presenting new opportunities to advance understanding of biological processes and systems and inspires new discoveries in areas that are understudied, and 2) it aids other disciplines to which it is applied by providing new and potentially transformative approaches to challenging questions that originate in biological systems. </p>
          <p>The proposed research and training plan for applications to this competitive area must include substantive and significant use of specimens and/or data from existing, archived biological research collections and their associated collection databases.  It must also document access to the collection and/or data as discussed below.</p>
          <p><strong>Fellowship Competitive Area 3: National Plant Genome Initiative (NPGI) Postdoctoral Research Fellowships</strong></p>
          <p>Plant improvement is undergoing a revolution through the application of new tools for genotyping and phenotyping, and in the quantitative theory used for selection. In addition, the flood of data being generated requires new computational tools to provide an effective framework for basic plant biology research and plant improvement. The purpose of these fellowships is to provide postdoctoral training opportunities that target interdisciplinary research in plant improvement and associated sciences such as physiology and pathology, quantitative genetics, and computational biology.  Applicants with strong backgrounds in a single disciplinary area may consider expanding their expertise with research in associated fields.  For example, a Ph.D. in plant breeding may consider a fellowship in statistical genetics with a focus on application to plant improvement. Plant breeding is increasingly interdisciplinary and requires sophisticated modeling and experimental techniques; therefore, new connections are needed between biology and the mathematical/computational/statistical sciences.</p>
          <p>Successful applicants will propose research and training plans that are significantly different from their graduate research and training and which address important scientific questions within the scope of the goals of the NPGI (<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/npgi_five-year_plan_5-2014.pdf">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/npgi_five-year_plan_5-2014.pdf</a>) and the specific guidelines in this Solicitation.<strong>  </strong>The overall goal of the NPGI is to develop a basic knowledge of the structures and functions of plant genomes and translate this knowledge to a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of economically important plants and plant processes of potential economic value. By bridging basic research and plant performance in the field, the NPGI aims to accelerate basic discovery and innovation in economically important plants and enable enhanced management of agriculture, natural resources, and the environment to meet societal needs.</p>
          <p>The panel reviews will be managed by NSF Program Directors and observed by USDA-ARS National Program Leaders and DOE Program Directors in programmatic areas relevant to Fellowship Competitive Area 3. As part of Competitive Area 3, applicants are encouraged to consider sponsors located at the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and USDA-ARS laboratories.  Fellows undertaking part or all of their research activities at the JGI will have the opportunity to contribute to improvements in genome assembly, annotation, and community access (through web-based activities such as Phytozome, Gramene, etc.) for completed, ongoing or planned plant genome projects.  The list of such projects is available at <a href="http://jgi.doe.gov/our-science/science-programs/plant-genomics/">http://jgi.doe.gov/our-science/science-programs/plant-genomics/</a>. Interested candidates must identify a specific project and address how their scientific expertise and career development would benefit from this interaction with the JGI. </p>
          <p>Successful applicants will be supported by either NSF or USDA-ARS.  Depending on the focus and location of the proposed research, up to five successful applicants may be supported by USDA-ARS fellowships.  Applicants selected for support by USDA-ARS will be contacted directly by NSF and informed of their selection for these additional fellowship opportunities. They will be instructed to withdraw their application to this Program as "funded elsewhere" and USDA-ARS will then initiate the appointment of these fellows directly.  All other awards will be made by NSF.</p>
          <p><strong>General description of BIO Postdoctoral Fellowships</strong></p>
          <p>A. Appropriateness for BIO and Program Priorities</p>
          <p>For Competitive Areas 1 and 2, a research and training plan with a focus within the scope of any of the core programs in the Directorate for the Biological Sciences (BIO) is eligible for support. Further restrictions may apply for particular postdoctoral competitions. Be aware: "Research with disease-related goals, including work on the etiology, diagnosis or treatment of physical or mental disease, abnormality, or malfunction in human beings or animals, is normally not supported. Animal models of such conditions or the development or testing of drugs or other procedures for their treatment also are not eligible for support."  See NSF Grant Proposal Guide, <a title="NSF Grant Proposal Guide" href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg</a>.  While it is expected that research of fundamental biological significance may often have broader impacts to medicine and human health, applications determined to have a clear biomedical focus will be returned without review. <strong>If your application mentions human disease</strong>, you should discuss its appropriateness with one of the listed Program Officers.  Priority is given to research areas where BIO plays a unique or special role among NSF programs and total Federal funding. If your research is in an area of biology not primarily funded by BIO or if you are uncertain, you are strongly encouraged to contact one of the BIO Program Officers to discuss the appropriateness of the research and training.</p>
          <p>B. Location of Work</p>
          <p>Research and training supported by these fellowships may be conducted at any appropriate U.S. or international host institution. Appropriate institutions include colleges and universities, private nonprofit institutes and museums, and government installations and laboratories. </p>
          <p>Because the objectives of the fellowships include broadening the perspectives and experiences of the Fellows and promoting interdisciplinary research careers, careful consideration should be given to the selection of the sponsoring scientists and host institutions.  For Competitive Areas 1 and 2, priority will be given to applicants who propose new locations for the fellowship.  Applicants who propose remaining in their current locations or positions must justify why a new location or position is not being proposed.  For Competitive Area 3, applicants planning to stay in their current positions must articulate how the new training planned under the fellowship would meet the goals of the National Plant Genome Initiative.   </p>
          <p>BIO encourages Fellows to gain international experience by selecting international hosts for at least part of the tenure of the fellowship when applying to all competitive areas.  For example, in addition to non-US academic institutions, NPGI (Competitive Area 3)  applicants may consider the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) Centers as potential hosts for international activities.  See <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye?http://cgiar.org/centers/index.html">http://cgiar.org/centers/index.html</a> for list of locations.</p>
          <p>Applicants to Competitive Areas 1 and 2 who plan to spend more than one year of the fellowship in a sponsoring laboratory overseas may request a 3-year fellowship that may include the final year at a U.S. laboratory after the international tenure. Both the international and U.S. locations must be included in the sponsoring scientist statement in the application.</p>
          <p>C. The Sponsoring Scientist(s)</p>
          <p>The Fellow must affiliate with a host institution(s) at all times during the entire tenure of the fellowship and select a sponsoring scientist(s) who will provide mentoring and guidance for both the research and training proposed by the applicant. The applicant is responsible for making prior arrangements with the host institution and sponsoring scientist(s). Regardless of the number of sponsors or locations, the fellowship application requires a single sponsoring scientist statement. When more than one sponsor is proposed, one must be named lead sponsor and information from all sponsors must be integrated into a single statement. Likewise, if more than one site is proposed, the sponsoring scientist statement must integrate all sponsors and locations in a single statement.</p>
          <p>An important basis for judging the suitability of the host institution is the degree to which the sponsoring scientist statement describes and offers a research environment and mentoring plan that could not be provided without fellowship support.</p>
          <p>If a fellowship is offered, the applicant may be requested to provide documentation from the host institution that the terms and conditions of the fellowship are acceptable and that the Fellow will be provided adequate mentoring, space, basic services, needed resources, and supplies. Once an application is submitted, any changes in location or sponsorship for the fellowship must be approved in advance by BIO.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>B. Stipend and Allowances</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For the basic fellowship, the total fellowship amount is $69,000 per year and consists of two types of payments: a stipend and a research and training allowance. A monthly stipend of $4,500 is paid directly to the Fellow.  The fellowship allowance of $15,000 per year is provided and spent at the Fellow's discretion, except foreign travel, which requires prior NSF approval. This allowance is intended to cover research- and training-related costs and fringe benefits. Allowable research and training costs include travel, such as short-term visits to other institutions or laboratories, field work, and attendance at scientific meetings, training, special equipment, IT equipment and software, supplies, publication costs, access fees for databases and other research-related expenses. The Fellow should keep records to document expenditures.  Allowable costs for fringe benefits include individual or family health insurance (any combination of medical, vision, and/or dental) whether purchased as a group or individual plan, disability insurance, retirement savings, dependent care, and moving expenses. All payments are made directly to the Fellow as an electronic funds transfer into a personal account at a U.S. financial institution.</p>
            <p>Within the fellowship period, one month per year of fellowship duration may be used for paid leave, including parental or family leave. The paid leave cannot be used to increase the level of NSF support beyond the duration of the fellowship. NSF enables career-life balance through a variety of mechanisms. For more information, please see <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/career-life-balance/">http://www.nsf.gov/career-life-balance/</a>.</p>
            <p>The fellowship amount can be increased to include a Facilitation Award for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED). When requesting FASED funding, applicants should contact the Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology program prior to applying. </p>
            <p>Fellowships may be supplemented by host scientists and host institutions with non-Federal funds but only if the additional funds do not carry additional responsibilities beyond the research and training supported by the fellowship.</p>

Page limits include pictures, figures, tables, graphics, etc.  Proposals that do not conform to these requirements and all page limitations will be returned without review.  You will not be given a chance to correct, shorten, or resubmit the application after the deadline.  Proposals must be submitted electronically via the NSF FastLane system. Only complete and timely applications will be accepted; non-compliant applications will be returned without review as will those that are incomplete or late. A complete FastLane submitted proposal requires materials from you (the applicant), a statement and CV from your sponsoring scientist(s), and 2 reference letters (one from the doctoral thesis advisor).</p>
        <p>Preparing your fellowship application is different in several ways from preparing a research proposal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Do not submit your proposal through a sponsored projects office at your home or host institution; you are submitting the proposal as an individual. You must first register as an individual researcher before you or your references can gain access to the application and reference procedures.  To use FastLane, go to the NSF Web site <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">http://www.nsf.gov/</a> and select "FastLane" or directly to the FastLane home page <a href="http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/">http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/</a>. Click on the <em>Postdoctoral Fellowships and Other Programs</em> tab. Click on "Applicant", then select Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Biology.  Complete step-by-step instructions on "How to apply" may be found on the program webpage.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The information needed from the sponsoring scientist(s) is found on the FastLane homepage after answering "Sponsoring Scientist" to the "Who are you?" question.  The sponsoring scientist statement and CV(s) must be uploaded into the application.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The information needed from the reference writers is found on the FastLane homepage after answering "Letter of Reference Writer" to the "Who are you?" question.  Your references enter their letters directly into FastLane.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>A complete postdoctoral fellowship application consists of the following</strong> (Note: <em>The entire application, with the exception of the letters of reference must be submitted by the fellowship applicant in FastLane)</em>:</p>
        <ol>
    <li> NSF Cover Page;</li>
    <li> FastLane application form (this form is unique to fellowships and can only be accessed in FastLane by following the directions as described herein.  Applications in which the form is incomplete will be returned without review.   Write in None or N/A if you have no information to provide for some of the items);</li>
       <li> Project Summary (Abstract of all fellowship activities) (limited to one page).  The Project Summary must include an overview and separate statements on intellectual merit and broader impacts.  The fellowship consists of research, training goals for the Fellow, and career development activities; therefore, all must be presented in the overview.  The research plans and goals should be described in the section on <strong>intellectual merit;</strong> training, career development, and educational or public outreach should be described in the section on <strong>broader impacts</strong>.  See Section VI. A. below for guidance from the National Science Board on additional broader impacts which you may wish to include.  If the project summary fails to clearly address in separate statements the intellectual merit and  broader impacts of the fellowship, the application will be returned without review.  If you are applying to Competitive Area 2, Interdisciplinary Collections, you must identify the collection(s) to be used in the research and training.  </li>
        <li> Project Description (Research and Training Plan) (limited to 6 pages, including all figures, tables, etc.) including a timetable with yearly goals with benchmarks for major anticipated outcomes and a description of future research and career directions.  You must identify and present goals for both the research and training components of the fellowship.  You must also address the broader impacts of the fellowship beyond your own training in this section; it is not adequate to address broader impacts only in the project summary.  Your application will be reviewed by an interdisciplinary panel and the research portion should not contain jargon and acronyms that are not understandable to a wide range of scientists.  Do not cut and past the project summary into the project description.  Space is very limited and repeating text robs you of valuable space to present your ideas and fully develop them.</li>
        <li> References Cited: bibliography for Project Description (no page limit);</li>
   <li> Biographical Sketch: Applicant's Curriculum Vitae (CV) limited to 2 pages (list publications and abstracts separately if you have both to report);</li>
        <li> Current and Pending Support: Include current and planned applications to other fellowship programs.<p></p>
</li><li> Supplementary Documentation consisting of:</li>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
          An abstract of your dissertation research (limited to one page);
          </li>

     For Competitive Area 2, documentation is required from the collection director that your proposed research meets all policies and requirements of the collection (this document must address access and is not to be an endorsement of your application); and
          </li>
          <li>
            A Data Management plan. <em>All </em>applications <em>must</em> include a supplementary document of no more than 2 pages labeled "Data Management Plan" that describes plans for data management and sharing of the products of research, or asserts the absence of the need for such plans.
          </li>
        </ul>
    <li> Two letters of reference, submitted directly in FastLane by the reference writers.  One should be your thesis advisor.</li></ol>
        <p><strong>Guidance on the Project Description (Research and Training Plan):</strong></p>
        <p>The research and training plan presents the research that you will conduct and the training that you will receive during the fellowship period and how they relate to your career goals.  Include in the research and training plan: 1) a very<strong> brief</strong> and informative introduction or background section; 2) a statement of research objectives, methods, and significance; 3) training objectives and plan for achieving them (these may include scientific as well as other career preparation activities); 4) an explanation of how the fellowship activities will enhance your career development and future research directions as well as describing how this research differs from your dissertation research; 5) a justification of the choice of sponsoring scientist(s) and host institution(s); and 6) a timetable with yearly goals with benchmarks for major anticipated outcomes.  As with all NSF proposals, broader impacts must also be addressed in this section.</p>
        <p>Some applications may require other documentation before the final decision can be made, <em>e.g.</em>, animal care and use, human subjects, government permits, letters of collaboration, and commitments from private sources. Their existence should be noted in the research and training plan, but they should <strong><em>not </em></strong>be included in the application unless they pertain to use of collections.  NSF may request them later.</p>
        <p><strong>Guidance on the Sponsoring Scientist(s) Statement:</strong></p>
        <p>The sponsoring scientist(s) statement is meant to show how the proposed host(s) and host institution(s) provide the best environment for the Fellow's proposed research and training plan and form the basis for a future independent research career. Therefore, it should include a specific mentoring plan, a description of how the Fellow's independence will be nurtured, and what aspects of the project, if any, cannot go when the Fellow leaves.  Regardless of the number of sponsors, one integrated statement must be developed and submitted.  If the Fellow plans to teach as part of career development activities, the Fellow is limited to teaching in a course taught by the sponsoring scientist(s) or as part of a course directly related to the Fellow's doctoral or fellowship research project. The sponsoring scientist(s) statement must detail the mentoring that the Fellow will receive on teaching if applicable.  Sponsors are not expected to provide all the mentoring themselves and may call on all resources available on campus or through other organizations, <em>e.g</em>., professional societies, postdoctoral offices, etc.</p>
        <p>Reminder: A complete sponsoring scientist statement consists of two parts; a CV of no more than two pages for each sponsor and a single discussion (no more than 3 pages) of the following items:</p>
        <ol>
       <li> A brief description of the research projects in the host research group(s), including a statement of current and pending research support, both private and public, for each sponsor. If any sponsor has submitted similar research for funding, the degree of overlap must be addressed.</li>
       <li> A description of how the research and training plan for the applicant would fit into and complement ongoing research of the sponsor(s) as well as an indication of the personnel with whom the Fellow would work.</li>
        <li>An explanation of how the sponsor(s) will determine what mentoring the applicant needs in research, teaching, and career development skills and how these would be translated into a specific plan that fosters the development of the applicant's future independent research career.</li>
       <li> A description of the role the sponsor(s) will play in the proposed research and training and the other resources that will be available to the Fellow to complete his or her training plan during the fellowship.</li>
       <li> A description of the limitations, if any, that will be placed on the Fellow regarding the research following the fellowship.</li></ol>
        <p>The sponsoring scientist statement should be uploaded into your application as a "Supplementary Document" in FastLane.</p>
        <p><strong>Guidance on the Reference Letters</strong></p>
        <p>Your application must also include the two references as listed on your application form. One should be your thesis advisor. Do <strong>not</strong> use your sponsoring scientist as a reference. Your references will need your FastLane-assigned temporary proposal number and a password that you assign. FastLane permits you to send them an email with this information or you can provide it to them directly. They must change the password the first time they login to the reference module. They complete a reference form in FastLane, upload a recommendation letter, and then submit the reference.</p>
        <p><strong>Proposal-submission Check List</strong></p>
        <p>This checklist is provided to aid in the preparation of the proposal, the burden to ensure that the proposal is complete and meets all of the solicitation requirements remains with the applicant.</p>

        <h3>
          VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES
        </h3>
  
        <p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program where they will be reviewed if they meet NSF proposal preparation requirements. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with the oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal.</p>
      <a name="reviewcrit" id="reviewcrit"></a> <h4> A. NSF Merit Review Criteria</h4>
        <p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board (NSB)-approved merit review criteria: intellectual merit and the broader impacts of the proposed effort. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>
        <p>The two NSB-approved merit review criteria are listed below. The criteria include considerations that help define them. These considerations are suggestions and not all will apply to any given proposal. While proposers must address both merit review criteria, reviewers will be asked to address only those considerations that are relevant to the proposal being considered and for which the reviewer is qualified to make judgments.</p>
        <p><strong>What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?</strong><br>
          How important is the proposed activity to advancing knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields? How well qualified is the proposer (individual or team) to conduct the project? (If appropriate, the reviewer will comment on the quality of the prior work.) To what extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived and organized is the proposed activity? Is there sufficient access to resources?</p>
        <p><strong>What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?</strong><br>
          How well does the activity advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, disability, geographic, etc.)? To what extent will it enhance the infrastructure for research and education, such as facilities, instrumentation, networks, and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding? What may be the benefits of the proposed activity to society? </p>
     
        <p>Examples illustrating activities likely to demonstrate broader impacts are available electronically on the NSF website at: <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf">http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>
        <p>Applicants are evaluated on their ability and accomplishments as evidenced by the submitted <em>CV. </em>The research and training plan is evaluated on its scientific merit, its feasibility, its significance in generating new biological knowledge, how significantly distinct the research is from the dissertation and other research experience, and its impact on the career development of the applicant.  Other important evaluative factors are the suitability and availability of the sponsoring scientist(s) and host institution(s), including colleagues and facilities.</p>
        <p>For <strong>Competitive Area 1</strong>,<strong> </strong> Broadening Participation. reviewers will assess how innovative and feasible is the plan to broaden the participation of an identified group under-represented in biology. Reviewers will assess the feasibility and appropriateness of the applicant's stated training goals.</p>
        <p>For <strong>Competitive Area 2</strong>, Interdisciplinary Research Using Collections, reviewers will consider how integral and significant to the proposed research and training is the selected collection(s), the likely availability of the collection(s), and how appropriate to the collection is the proposed research and training.  Reviewers will assess the feasibility and appropriateness of the applicant's stated training goals.</p>
        <p>For <strong>Competitive Area 3</strong>, National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowships, applicants may first be screened by NSF Program Directors for the relevance of the proposed research and training to the goals of the National Plant Genome Initiative and this Postdoctoral Fellowship opportunity.  Project summaries must clearly describe the relevance of the proposed research and training to the goals of the National Plant Genome Initiative as well as this Postdoctoral Fellowship opportunity. Applications lacking this information or where the relevance is insufficient will be returned without review as<strong> "not responsive to the program solicitation".  </strong></p>
        <p>The NPGI Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are intended to provide both research and interdisciplinary training opportunities to young scientists as they begin establishing independence in their selected areas of research. Accordingly, the program is required to balance several factors in selecting the most competitive applications for awards. <br>
          <br>
          For this reason, reviewers are asked to assess the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strong intellectual merit and broader impacts of the proposed work</li>
          <li>Proposed activities address the goals of the NPGI and PGRP</li>
          <li>Proposed activities address the goal of the NPGI PRFB by providing training opportunities that target interdisciplinary research in one or more areas related to plant improvement, genomics, physiology, pathology, quantitative genetics, or computational biology.</li>
          <li>Mentors' expertise and integration of training with the proposed research</li>
          <li>Applicant's expertise</li>
          <li>Evidence of applicant's strong independent scientific thinking and initiative</li>
          <li>Evidence of applicant's productivity as a graduate student</li>
          <li>Evidence of a desire to train the next generation of plant breeders</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>NSF staff also will give careful consideration to the following in making funding decisions:</p>
        <p><em><strong>Integration of Research and Education</strong></em><br>
          One of the principal strategies in support of NSF's goals is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives.</p>
     
        <p><em><strong>Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities</strong></em><br>
          Broadening opportunities and enabling the participation of all citizens -- women and men, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities -- is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.</p>

        <h4> 
          B. Review and Selection Process
        </h4>
        <p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by</p>
       <p>Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>
        <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.</p>
  
        <p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>
        <p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.</p>
        <p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.</p>

        <p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.</p>
        <p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.</p>
        <p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.</p>
        <p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF <em>Award &amp; Administration Guide</em> (AAG) Chapter II, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=aag</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional Reporting Requirements:</strong> </p>
        <p>Applicants must file starting and termination certificates in addition to annual and final technical reports.</p>

        <h3>
         ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
        </h3>
        <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."</p>
        <p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>
        <p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.</p>
        <p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em> provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See Grant Proposal Guide Chapter II, Section D.2 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf (TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 877-8339.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation Information Center may be reached at (703) 292-5111.</p>

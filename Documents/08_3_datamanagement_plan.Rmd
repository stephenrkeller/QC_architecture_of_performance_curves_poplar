All publicly funded research should be made accessible to the public and other researchers so that findings are tractable, transparent, and reproducible. Over the course of my dissertation training, I have integrated open access to every stage of the scientific process using the Github platform (Noble 2009; Michener 2015). Each project that is a publishable unit will be arranged by tasks associated with the scientific method in the following folders: *data*, *analysis*, *results*, and *documentation*. All raw and processed data accompanied with metadata will be stored in the *data* folder. Physical copies  of raw data in data collection notebooks will be copied and stored in three separate locations. The analysis folder will hold my scripts for which I analyzed. Outcomes of the analyses and associated figures will be stored in the *results* folder. Protocols and manuscripts will be stored in the *documentation* folder. For greater transparency, a *notebook* and *readme* file will accompany the project folder. The *notebook* will log daily activities and the *readme file* will outline in detail, the project layout and file descriptions. To ensure reproducibility and repeatability, the whole project will be accessible via Github (https://github.com/adnguyen). Lastly, whole projects will be backed up on two physical hard drives, alos stored in separate locations. \newline

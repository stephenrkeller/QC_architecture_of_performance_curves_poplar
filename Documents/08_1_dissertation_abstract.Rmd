Temperature is a fundamental environmental force shaping species abundance
and distributions through its effects on biochemical reaction rates, metabolism, activity,and reproduction. In light of future climate shifts, mainly driven by temperature increases, how will organisms persist in a variable environment? In particular, ants are a good system to understand the physiological mechanisms associated with temperature tolerances because they have been able to diversify into thermally stressful environments.

\textbf{Introduction/Motivation}  \newline
\end{raggedleft}   
  
  Gene by environment (G x E) interactions muddle our ability to predict how organisms can persist in a variable environment.  

\begin{raggedleft}
\textbf{Research Objectives}  \newline
\end{raggedleft}   
  I propose to study the G x E interactions within balsam poplar.

\textbf{Training Objectives} 
\end{raggedleft}
The training objectives I have developed involve **3 general goals**: 1) Apply my current evolutionary physiology background in insects (ants) to plant systems; 2) Acquire more statistical and bioinformatic tools to uncover complex biological patterns associated with genomic and phenotypic datasets; 3) Optimally communicate science to diverse backgrounds.    

**Goal 1**: One of the first steps in applying theory is getting to know your organism. Therefore, a foundation in natural history of balsam poplar will be absolutely critical for how I approach analyzing data. To achieve this goal, I will not only delve into the primary literature (or should I have done this by now?) but also aide in ongoing common gardens in Burlington, Vt and Indian head Canada, which will also involve interacting with experts in the field. 

**Goal 2**: Although I have worked with next-generation genomic data in my dissertation, there is much more to learn, particularly with respect to creating genotype-phenotype maps across varying season lengths. To aide in this goal, I will consult and meet with my post-doctoral advisor on a weekly basis when data are ready to be analyzed. 

**Goal 3**:
1. Learn about the natural history of poplar and plant systems in general
2. Aquire more statistical and bioinformatic tools in analyzing next generation sequence data. 
3. Usher in the next wave of scientists
4. Communicate findings at scientific meetings and local poplar farmers
